abstract = {RPL is the de-facto IPv6-based routing protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT), where networks are mainly formed by sensors and other low capacity devices. However, RPL lacks scalability and is inefficient in any-to-any communications. In this article, we present IoTorii, a hierarchical protocol that creates routes based on a probe frame, instead of the computation of a distance vector, as in RPL. We implemented a proof-of-concept of IoTorii and compared it with RPL, proving lower number of table entries, decreased exchanged control messages and faster convergence time, with similar path hop count, which is particularly promising in the IoT field.}

abstract = {The incorporation of end devices in the edge-to-cloud continuum yields substantial benefits to conventional cloud computing frameworks, expediting communication between end devices and computational resources, and resulting in new use cases, particularly in the field of mobile networks. However, few related works leverage the full potential of resource sharing at the far edge, as most proposals require that end nodes rely on a higher-capacity computational node. This manuscript presents Multi-Hop Wireless Resource Sharing Protocol (MuHoW), a lightweight protocol tailored for multi-hop wireless networks. MuHoW enables resource sharing within collaborative edge-computing networks by facilitating the discovery of wireless neighbours and subsequently establishing a confluence tree directed towards the edge/fog infrastructure. This tree serves as a conduit for aggregating essential resource sharing information, ensuring the establishment of a seamless collaborative edge/fog environment. The empirical findings highlight the scalability of MuHoW, due to its linear control message growth with network size. Moreover, the efficiency of the protocol is very high even in lossy environments as evidenced by the fact that most resource sharing messages are successfully delivered as expected.}

In order to avoid manual configuration, many of them require centralized administrators which constitute a clear bottleneck, while distributed approaches do not guarantee sufficient flexibility or robustness. This paper describes and evaluates GA3 (Generalized Automatic Address Assignment), a discovery protocol that assigns multiple unique labels to all the switches in a hierarchical network, without any modification of hosts or the standard Ethernet frames. Labeling is distributed and uses probes. These labels can be leveraged for shortest path routing without tables, as in the case of the Torii protocol, but GA3 also allows other label-based routing protocols (such as PortLand or ALIAS). Additionally, GA3 can detect miswirings in the network. Furthermore, control traffic is only necessary upon network deployment rather than periodically. Simulation results showed a reduced convergence time of less than 2 s and 100 kB/s of bandwidth (to send the GA3 frames) in the worst case for popular data center topologies, which outperforms other similar protocols.}

    abstract =  {Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which both the routers and their interconnect are constrained. LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power). Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability. LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers. Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN), point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point). This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are supported. Support for point-to-point traffic is also available. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},

abstract = {This paper studies the routing protocol “Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol – Next Generation (LOADng)”, designed to enable efficient, scalable and secure routing in low power and lossy networks. As a reactive protocol, it does not maintain a routing table for all destinations in the network, but initiates a route discovery to a destination only when there is data to be sent to that destination to reduce routing overhead and memory consumption. Designed with a modular approach, LOADng can be extended with additional components for adapting the protocol to different topologies, traffic, and data-link layer characteristics. This paper studies several such additional components for extending LOADng: support for smart route requests and expanding ring search, an extension permitting maintaining collection trees, a fast rerouting extension. All those extensions are examined from the aspects of specification, interoperability with other mechanisms, security vulnerabilities, performance and applicability. A general framework is also proposed to secure the routing protocol.}

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the classic centralized cloud computing paradigm faces several challenges such as high latency, low capacity and network failure. To address these challenges, fog computing brings the cloud closer to IoT devices. The fog provides IoT data processing and storage locally at IoT devices instead of sending them to the cloud. In contrast to the cloud, the fog provides services with faster response and greater quality. Therefore, fog computing may be considered the best choice to enable the IoT to provide efficient and secure services for many IoT users. This paper presents the state-of-the-art of fog computing and its integration with the IoT by highlighting the benefits and implementation challenges. This review will also focus on the architecture of the fog and emerging IoT applications that will be improved by using the fog model. Finally, open issues and future research directions regarding fog computing and the IoT are discussed.},

It provides the ability to remotely monitor, manage and control devices, and to create new insights and actionable information from massive streams of real-time data. The main features of a smart city include a high degree of information technology integration and a comprehensive application of information resources. The essential components of urban development for a smart city should include smart technology, smart industry, smart services, smart management and smart life. The Internet of Things is about installing sensors (RFID, IR, GPS, laser scanners, etc.) for everything, and connecting them to the internet through specific protocols for information exchange and communications, in order to achieve intelligent recognition, location, tracking, monitoring and management. With the technical support from IoT, smart city need to have three features of being instrumented, interconnected and intelligent. Only then a Smart City can be formed by integrating all these intelligent features at its advanced stage of IOT development. The explosive growth of Smart City and Internet of Things applications creates many scientific and engineering challenges that call for ingenious research efforts from both academia and industry, especially for the development of efficient, scalable, and reliable Smart City based on IoT. New protocols, architectures, and services are in dire needs to respond for these challenges. The goal of the special issue is to bring together scholars, professors, researchers, engineers and administrators resorting to the state-of-the-art technologies and ideas to significantly improve the field of Smart City based on IoT.}

The OF has as the main function to select and specify the best parent or the optimal path to reach the destination. However, proposing an adequate objective function in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) presents a substantial challenge. In this paper, we propose a survey on existing objective functions in LLNs based on a set of metrics. These metrics can define a node or/and link characteristics. We highlight the advantages and the shortcoming of each studied solution. Furthermore, we propose a classification of the used metrics and the criteria of choice. Then, we present a comparative study of the existing OFs in terms of the required performances of the RPL protocol and we provide a deep statistical analysis of all reviewed papers. Finally, we conclude our contribution by highlighting the different issues and challenges that can be exploited for future works. We believe that this survey will help LLNs researchers’ community to easily understand the objective function concept and contributes to improving RPL in this context for further relevant research works.}

abstract = {Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) is a new paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT) where devices are inherently mobile. While mobility enables innovative applications and allows new services, it remains a challenging issue as it causes disconnection of nodes and intermittent connectivity, which negatively impacts the network operation and performance. In addition, energy saving presents a real challenge for networks with limited resources. In this context, a new energy efficient and mobility aware routing protocol called EMA-RPL is proposed based on the well-known Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (the RPL standard). Unlike the RPL which is basically designed for static devices, EMA-RPL enables better sustaining of connectivity of mobile nodes and conserving energy. The proposed protocol integrates an enhanced mobility detection method through a continuous control of the distance between the mobile node and its attachment, a novel point of attachment prediction based on the new location of the mobile node, and an efficient replacement strategy preserving the mobile node energy. EMA-RPL overcomes and mitigates problems caused by the mobility of nodes. Simulations using Cooja/Contiki show that EMA-RPL outperforms both the RPL and its mobility aware variant (MRPL) in terms of handover delay, data loss rate, signaling cost and energy consumption.}

Low cost, low data rate features of ZigBee results in low power consumption and makes it useful in wireless sensor networks, increasing life of small batteries of nodes in the network. Since tree routing in ZigBee does not require any routing tables to send the packet to the destination, it can be used in ZigBee end devices that have limited resources. Routing protocols such as AODV (Ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing), ZTR (ZigBee tree routing), and STR (Shortcut tree routing) are compared on the basis of different performance metrics (End to end delay, routing overload, throughput, packet delivery ratio). An extensive simulation in NS2 is carried out. The performance evaluation shows that STR achieves better performance as compared to other two routing protocols. But there are some limitations of the STR method. Performance of packet delivery ratio of STR is less as compared to AODV. Performance of end to end delay of STR is poor as compared to AODV. Hence ESTR is proposed. The main aim of proposed ESTR [Extended STR] is to present new ZigBee network routing protocol with goal of improving the performance of ESTR in terms of PDR and delay against STR and AODV.}

abstract="We demonstrate how the framework that is used for creating efficient number-theoretic ID and signature schemes can be transferred into the setting of lattices. This results in constructions of the most efficient to-date identification and signature schemes with security based on the worst-case hardness of problems in ideal lattices. In particular, our ID scheme has communication complexity of around 65,000 bits and the length of the signatures produced by our signature scheme is about 50,000 bits. All prior lattice-based identification schemes required on the order of millions of bits to be transferred, while all previous lattice-based signature schemes were either stateful, too inefficient, or produced signatures whose lengths were also on the order of millions of bits. The security of our identification scheme is based on the hardness of finding the approximate shortest vector to within a factor of {\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}O{\}}(n^2){\$}in the standard model, while the security of the signature scheme is based on the same assumption in the random oracle model. Our protocols are very efficient, with all operations requiring {\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}O{\}}(n){\$}time.",

abstract={Quantum computing promises to be the next disruptive technology, with numerous possible applications and implications for organizations and markets. Quantum computers exploit principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to represent data and perform operations on them. Both of these principles enable quantum computers to solve very specific, complex problems significantly faster than standard computers. Against this backdrop, this fundamental gives a brief overview of the three layers of a quantum computer: hardware, system software, and application layer. Furthermore, we introduce potential application areas of quantum computing and possible research directions for the field of information systems.},
